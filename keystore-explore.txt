KeyStore entries can be quickly exported by dragging them onto your desktop. The formats used when drag exporting are:
Key Pair: PKCS #12 with entry's password
Trusted Certificate: X.509 PEM


You can set a minimum threshold for the quality of passwords used to protect KeyStores and exported files of relevant types.
Go to Tools > Preferences > Password Quality to configure this feature.
Mac OS users: KeyStore Explorer > Preferences > Password Quality


You can configure KeyStore Explorer to use a proxy for Internet access. This may be required if 
you are using the Examine SSL or Check for Update features.
Go to Tools > Preferences > Internet Proxy and make the appropriate settings.
Mac OS users: KeyStore Explorer > Preferences > Internet Proxy.


You can export any single certificate from a key pair entry's chain of certificates.
To do this view the key pair entry's Certificate Chain Details, select the required 
certificate and press the PEM button followed by the Export button.
