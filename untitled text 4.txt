As discussed, 
 
create the headlines like 
 
- Introduction of SSL with Censhare 5.5
describe about the new security feature, that certificates have to be trusted and why. Make clear that the customer has 3 options:
 self signed, by a CA or ignore 
- Generate own keystore 
-- with self signed certificate (at the start, describe that the customer has to give the public certificate to every client and they have to trust this) 
-- with CA reply by a CA 
- import existing certificate chain to the keystore 
- ignore untrusted SSL certificate by a client

====================== 

1. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a 
 censhare server and a censhare client  SSL allows sensitive informations
 and login credentials to be transmitted securely. Normally, data sent between censhare clients and censhare servers is sent in 
 plain textâ€”leaving you vulnerable to eavesdropping. If an attacker is able to intercept all data being sent 
 between a Censhare client and a censhare server they can see and use that information.
 
 2. Features:
 a) Encrypts information
  SSL certificate ensures the Assets of censhare you send online are read by only the intended recipient and none else. 
  In this process, the Censhare data traverse multiple servers or computers  before they reach the recipient. On the way, the data
  could be accessed by unauthorized third parties. However, SSL makes some changes in the original
  data so that the data cannot be read by the third parties.
  
 b) Authentication - improves customers' trust
 Having SSL certificate ensures authentication. By authentication, we mean interpreting the sent data to the target
 server and not to unauthorized third parties. This is important because,
 as we have said, the data travels across multiple computers and can be accessed by unintended third parties.
 
 c) Better search engine rankings
Google recently added having a SSL certificate as one of the ranking parameters for search results. 
Having a SSL certificate brings your site a competitive advantage in Google's search engine results pages (SERPs).

d) Decrease in phishing scams: 
As an enterprise, the last thing you want is for cyberattackers to masquerade as your business in order to 
get personal data from unsuspecting customers.These days, phishing represents perhaps the single biggest 
threat to Web transactions.

 1. We can a create a CA signed certificate from the Keystore explorer  
 2. Generate the CA Signed certificate
